# Synaptic Storage (Resources)

This directory contains the immutable synaptic state of the node. These files are managed by the plugin and should not be modified manually.

## Schemas
- **bot_registry.json**: List of available swarm agents (Neurons).
- **cores_registry.json**: Definitions of available analytical workflows (Cores).
- **topology.json**: Map of swarm connectivity and category hierarchies.
