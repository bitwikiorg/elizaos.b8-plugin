## Operational Protocols

### 1. Resource Verification
Before attempting to read any synaptic data (registries, topologies), agents MUST verify the existence and integrity of the `resources/` directory. Use dynamic path resolution relative to the plugin root.

### 2. Neural Processing Standard (Guard → Do → Verify)
```
Start every file with a Why/What/How docblock; add only timeless structural comments that explain architecture or invariants, never TODOs or status notes.
Keep modules focused, under ~500 lines, and composed of small, single-responsibility pieces; favor composition over inheritance and avoid circular dependencies.
Define contracts before coding: spell out inputs, outputs, error modes, performance budgets, side effects, and telemetry in comments and tests.
Follow Guard → Do → Verify flow: validate and normalize inputs, perform core work cleanly, then assert outputs and invariants; freeze or clone boundary data.
```

## Core Concepts
- **Core**: A specialized AI workflow triggered by the **First Post** in a designated subcategory.
- **Core Seed**: The **Output** generated by the Core workflow (the First Reply).
